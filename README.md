# Zellers
Optional assignment to compute the day of the week of a specific day using Zeller's algorithm.

Zeller's algorithm computes the day of the week on which a given date will fall (or fell).

In this exercise, you will write a program to run Zeller's algorithm on a specific date.
The program should use the algorithm outlined below to compute the day of the week on which the user's birthday fell in the year you were born and print the result to the screen.
